<section id="developer-story">
  <h2>Developer Story</h2>
  <p>CraftLauncher was created by Tevo2, a developer who’s been deeply involved in the Minecraft community for years. His journey began with a passion for clean, secure software — and a personal experience that shaped his mission.</p>
  <p>Tevo2 was once affected by a malicious virus hidden inside a launcher called TL. That moment sparked a deep concern for user safety and transparency. He saw firsthand how easy it was for shady software to spread, and how little protection users had when trusting unknown tools.</p>
  <p>Since then, Tevo2 has committed to building tools that are lightweight, open, and respectful of user privacy. CraftLauncher is a reflection of that — no ads, no trackers, no hidden code. Just pure gameplay, built with care.</p>
  <p>If you’ve ever worried about what’s running behind the scenes, you’re not alone. That’s why CraftLauncher exists — to give players a launcher they can trust.</p>
